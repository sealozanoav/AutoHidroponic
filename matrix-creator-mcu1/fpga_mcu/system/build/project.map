    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   1,200    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      1
      Number with same-slice register load:      0
      Number with same-slice carry load:         1
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    25 out of     600    4%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                        28 out of   1,200    2%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           81
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            10 out of      81   12%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  27 out of      81   33%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          44 out of      81   54%
    Number of unique control sets:               7
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              13 out of   4,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
